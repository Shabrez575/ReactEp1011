- HIGHER ORDER COMPONENT
  (Higher Order component is a function that takes a component and returns a component).
- Why we use it , where we use it and its benefit to use.
- It just a function they just take a component and they just return another component.(That component has enhanced version of input component.)

- Passing Props in nested child.
- If we want to passing the data into child of the child component(nested child component).Then we have to passed it as a hierarchical orde. This process is called props drilling.
- But let suppose if you have more level of nested component then how you will passed the data into it.

Problem with props drilling - To deals with we will used context.
- In class based component we can not used hooks here because we don't have hooks.
- But we have other way to use hooks inside class based component is userContext.Consumer.
